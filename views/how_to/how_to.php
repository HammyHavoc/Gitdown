        <h1>How to Use Gitdown</h1>

        <p>First off, Thank you for choosing Gitdown to power your website!</p>

        <p>Let's quickly go over how to use this plugin.</p>

        <p>This tutorial is split into two sections: The Setup and Managing Article. The Setup is a little bit harder than the managing so lets get right into it.</p>


        <h2>Setup</h2>

        <p>So you want to publish your markdown articles from a remote repository like github to your wordpress blog. This means that you will have to first define the location of your github repository in the settings. The Gitdown settings are located at <i><a href="<?php echo home_url('/wp-admin/options-reading.php'); ?>" target="_blank">Reading</a></i>.</p>

        
        <?php image(GD_ROOT_URL.'views/how_to/github-copy-repo-url.png', 'Where to find your github repository link.'); ?>
        

        <?php info('By default there is repository there that I have created so you can test out and understand how Gitdown works without having a repo ready yourself.'); ?>

        <p>Now that you have a repository set Gitdown will clone and fetch this repository to your <code>wp-content</code>folder.</p>

        <br><br><br>

        <p class="mt-8">Next up we need to tell gitdown where to find the files that represent the Articles within your repository. We do this with a <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.glob.php">glob pattern</a>.</p>

        <p>Glob Patterns are like Regular Expressions but for File Systems, for example <code>*.md</code> means match all files in the current folder ending with <code>.md</code> or <code>**/article.txt</code> means match all files in any direct subfolder of the current directory ending that are called <code>article.txt</code></p>

        <p>Below you see <a href="https://globster.xyz" target="_blank">globster.xyz</a>, an awesome little website that can help you figure out and understand glob patterns. Edit the pattern at the top to see which files light up.</p>

        <iframe style="width: 100%" height="450" src="<?php echo $globsterURL ?>" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts"></iframe>

        <p>Now that you know how glob patterns work you can use them in the Gitdown settings.</p>

        <?php info('You can specifiy multiple glob pattern by seperating them with a comma like this: <code>*.md,*.txt</code>'); ?>            

        <br><br><br>

        <p>We got the hard part out of the way lets also quickly look at the resolver function.</p>

        <p>In the background every article that was found will be put through a function called a resolver and it will try to find out the meta information of the article this way.</p>

        <p>At the moment there are two resolver functions</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Simple</b>: Will look for YAML Style front matter at the top of the markdown file and it will parse the, title, slug, description, category, status and obviously its content. It will also search for a file called <code>preview.png</code> and add that as the thumbnail.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Directory to Category</b>: This Resolver has only one difference to the simple on and that is that it will change the category from the article to the directory path of its file within the repo and it will set the file name as the title.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will most likely be fine with the simple resolver.</p>

        <p>Now that you have setup everything you can go to the main admin page of the plugin, where you see all your found posts.</p>

        <?php warning('Articles are connected via their slug/post_name which means Gitdown will think an article that was on your Blog before that matches another article in your repo are the same and it will overwrite it so It is advised to make a backup of your articles. This also means that if you change the slug of any article it will no longer match its counterpart on git or wordpress.') ?>
        

        <br><br><br>

        <p class="mt-8">To Recap, setting up consists of ...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Specifiying the repository.</li>
            <li>Configurating a glob pattern.</li>
            <li>Setting a resolver function.</li>
        </ol>


        <br><br><br>
        

        <h2>Managing Articles</h2>

        <?php image(GD_ROOT_URL.'views/how_to/managing.png', 'Gitdown\'s User Interface'); ?>

        <p>Gitdown's User Interface is pretty straight forward, it consist of some buttons at the top to update / publish / delete all posts. These buttons are also individually available for each article.</p>

        <p>The second column will show you wether the post is on wordpress, which as stated earlier means that gitdown found a post with the same slug.</p>

        <p>Thats it have fun writing and publishing with Gitdown! ðŸ˜€</p>
        
        <?php warning('Since Gitdown adds and overwrittes articles, you should not edit these articles yourself since you could lose content that you made.'); ?>

        <?php warning('Gitdown will not resize your images to the sizes that Wordpress and your theme have defined so it is advised to use another plugin to do that.'); ?>

        <?php warning('Gitdown will (for now) not get the tags from your frontmatter info and insert them into the wordpress post.'); ?>
