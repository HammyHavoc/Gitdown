# Keys

Below you see a table which tells you which key in the frontmatter corresponds to which property of your article in wordpress.

| Frontmatter Key | Wordpress Property |
|---|---|
| `name` | The name of the Post. |
| `slug` | The Slug / Post Name of the Post which is the part that is sometimes appended to the URL. This is also the unique identifier of the posts in Gitdown. |
| `description` | The Post Excerpt. |
| `tags` | Post Tags. |
| `category` | Post Categories. This can be a list or a single string that contains nested categories. |
| `status` | The status of the post. `publish`, `draft` or `trash` |

[Here](example.md) you find an example of a working markdown file that contains all the keys.
