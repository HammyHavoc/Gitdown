## Can I supply multiple glob patterns?

Yes you can! Simply seperate them by commas.

## Does Gitdown read nested categories from the markdown file?

Yes it does! Something like Animals/Cats, will create these two classes in a nested fashion and add the last one as the category.

## Does Gitdown read tags?

Yes It does! You can supply either a list of tags or a single tag.

## Does Gitdown support thumbnails?

Yes It does! You simply have to provide a file called 'preview.png' in the same folder as your article and it will be added as the thumbnail. This means that you should have a folder for each article.
